ReactJs frontend demo application

In order to avoid CORS and other errors due to loading resources from file:/// you must have running local server.  
The simplest way to start server is to have installed Python.  

Just go to your terminal and do the following (but make sure you are on python 3)  
`python -m http.server 8080`  
By default, this will start server that will be listening on all interfaces and on port 8080.  
If you want to listen to a specific interface, do the following:  
`python -m http.server 8080 --bind 127.0.0.1`  
Also starting from Python 3.7, you can use the â€“directory flag to serve files from a directory that is not necessarily the current directory.
